SELinux allows you to export/import the current configuration of the machine.


If you have several machines configured the same way you may want to modify the SELinux configuration on one machine and then export the configuration to a file.  Then you could copy that file to another machine and import it on that machine.

Note, If you import a configuration to a machine, the local configuration will get removed.
