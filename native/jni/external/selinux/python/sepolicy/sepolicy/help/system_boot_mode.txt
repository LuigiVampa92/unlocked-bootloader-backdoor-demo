SELinux Systems can boot in three different modes.


* Enforcing mode (Default)
  - SELinux security policy is enforced.
* Permissive
  - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
* Disabled
  - No SELinux policy is loaded, SELinux does not run.

You can use this screen to change the enforcing mode.

Note if you disable SELinux, you will need to reboot, to turn it off.  Also the next time you turn SELinux on, a full system relabel will be performed.
