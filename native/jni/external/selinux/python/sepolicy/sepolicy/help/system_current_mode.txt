You can switch SELinux between Enforcing mode and Permissive mode.


When a machine is in permissive mode, SELinux will continue to log SELinux AVC messages, that would have been denied if the machine was in enforcing mode.

Changing the current mode of the system will not survive a reboot.  You would need to change the system mode for this.
