If you have more then one policy type installed,  the advanced screen will become visible.  You can select the advanced tab and modify the policy type that SELinux is running with.

Policy types are installed as sub-directories of /etc/selinux.

Changing the policy type of the machine will require a system relabeled in permissive mode. The gui will insure that proper labels get assigned on the next reboot.
