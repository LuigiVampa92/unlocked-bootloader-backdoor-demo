This screen shows the SELinux process 'types' which will transition to the '%(APP)s' type when executing the 'Commands File Paths'.


Under SELinux, when a process running with a 'type' attempts to execute an executable, one of three things can happen.

1.  The process can be prevented from running the executable.
2.  The executable executes with the same label as parent.
3.  The executable 'transitions' to a new 'type' based on policy.

This screen shows the executables that transition to another domain when '%(APP)s' executes them, and the 'SELinux Application Type' of the newly created process.
