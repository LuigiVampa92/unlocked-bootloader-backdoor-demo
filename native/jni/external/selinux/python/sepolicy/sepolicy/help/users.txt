By Default on a SELinux Targeted Policy system, all users login using the unconfined_t user.

SELinux has a very powerful concept called confined users.  You can setup individual users on your system to login with different SELinux user types.  This SELinux User Screen allows you to create/modify SELinux Users and map them to SELinux Roles and MLS/MCS Ranges

Default SELinux Users:

* Terminal user/ssh - guest_u
  - No Network, No setuid, no exec in homedir

* Browser user/kiosk - xguest_u
  - Web access ports only.  No setuid, no exec in homedir

* Full Desktop user - User_u
  - Full Network, No SETUID.

* Confined Admin/Desktop User - Staff_u
  - Full Network, sudo to admin only, no root password.  Usually a confined admin

* Unconfined user - unconfined_u (Default)
  - SELinux does not block access.
