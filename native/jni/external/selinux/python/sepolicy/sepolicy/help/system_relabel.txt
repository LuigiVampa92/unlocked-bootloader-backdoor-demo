SELinux is a labeling system.  Sometimes the labels on disk can get messed up.  One way to fix this is to trigger a full relabel on the next boot.


You can toggle this behavior using this screen.

Note:  Sometimes a simple restorecon is all you need to fix the labels on a file or directory.

If you add a new disk which does not have labels you could simply execute

# restorecon -R -v PATHTODISK
