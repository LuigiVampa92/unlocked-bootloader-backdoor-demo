.SH DESCRIPTION

semodule_link is a developer tool for manually linking together
a set of SELinux policy module packages into a single policy module package.
This tool is not necessary for normal operation of SELinux.  In normal
operation, such linking is performed internally by libsemanage in
response to semodule commands.  Module packages are created by
