TODO List for mcstrans:

In compute_raw_from_trans look for conflicting bit patterns and report errors.

In emit_whitespace look at whitespace characters for any regex special character and escape them. 

Make prefixes and suffixes optional (ex. SECRET REL AUS == SECRET AUS).

compute_trans_from_raw is an expensive operation that needs to be sped up or threaded so that mcstrans can respond to other requests more quickly.

Reevaluate the means of determining whether inverse bits are used in a domain.
