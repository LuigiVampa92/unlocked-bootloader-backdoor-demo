.TH GENHOMEDIRCON "8" "Sep 2011" "Security Enhanced Linux" "SELinux"
.SH NAME
genhomedircon \- generate SELinux file context configuration entries for user home directories
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B genhomedircon
is a script that executes
.B semodule
to rebuild the currently active SELinux policy (without reloading it) and to create the
labels for each user home directory based on directory paths returned by calls to getpwent().

The latter functionality depends on the "usepasswd" parameter being set to "true" (default)
in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.

This script is usually executed by
.B semanage
although this default behavior can be optionally modified by setting to "true" the
"disable-genhomedircon" in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.

Directories can be excluded from the list of home directories by the setting "ignoredirs"
in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.
