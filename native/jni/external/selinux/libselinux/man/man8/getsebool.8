.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B getsebool 
reports where a particular SELinux boolean or
all SELinux booleans are on or off
In certain situations a boolean can be in one state with a pending 
change to the other state.  getsebool will report this as a pending change.
The pending value indicates
the value that will be applied upon the next boolean commit.

The setting of boolean values occurs in two stages; first the pending
value is changed, then the booleans are committed, causing their
active values to become their pending values.  This allows a group of
booleans to be changed in a single transaction, by setting all of
their pending values as desired and then committing once.
